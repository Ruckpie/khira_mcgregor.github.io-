<br><h1>Khira K mcgregor</h1>
<p>I, Khira K Mcgregor agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Summer 2020 WEB_110_85 Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor, Daniel Von Briesen.

<br>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

<br>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

<br>Signed, <a href="introduction.html">Khira Kathleen Mcgregor</a> 5/22/2020 </p>
